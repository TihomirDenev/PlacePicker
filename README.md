# üìù Description
- Place Picker is a dynamic web application that enables users to interactively select and manage their favorite places from a list. The application features a user-friendly interface where places are displayed, and users can click to add them to their favorites. This action triggers a backend service that processes the addition and updates the user's favorite list in real-time. Conversely, users can also remove places from their favorites, which updates both the frontend display and the backend data store accordingly.

- The application is built using Angular, providing a robust and responsive client-side experience. It interacts with a backend service built on Node.js, which handles all data management tasks, including storing, retrieving, and updating places in a database. This ensures that user preferences are persisted across sessions and that data consistency is maintained.

- Furthermore, the Place Picker includes an advanced error handling mechanism. When the application encounters a data transmission error or a failure in API responses, it triggers a modal dialog via an error service. This modal provides users with a friendly notification about the issue and potential steps to resolve it, enhancing the overall user experience by managing expectations and maintaining interaction continuity.
